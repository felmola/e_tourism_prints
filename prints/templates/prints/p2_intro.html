    <p>In this part there will be a market for tourist packages. The market has a total of 5 negotiation rounds. Before
        starting the first negotiation round, the computer will randomly assign you to one of two roles: either the
        buyer role or the seller role. Keep in mind that the role to which you were assigned will be maintained during
        the 5 negotiation rounds.</p>

    <p>The objective of the market is that buyers and sellers can negotiate and eventually complete transactions
        successfully in each of the negotiation rounds. The results of the transactions will affect your final payments.</p>

    <p>In this market each commodity is a tourist package. In total there are 5 types of tourist packages whose only
        difference will be the destination: Bahamas, Jamaica, Cuba, Hawaii and Palau.</p>

    <p>In each of the negotiation rounds, first the sellers will set prices to the packages they will sell and then the
        buyers will see a list containing the packages available in the market and the prices of each of these packages.
        To complete a transaction, buyers must select the package of their preference and purchase it.</p>

    <p>Before starting, both sellers and buyers will have an initial endowment of 3 Experimental Currency Units (ECU) in
        each of the trading rounds to make their decisions.</p>

    <p>Please click on the "Next" button to start the first round of negotiation.</p>
