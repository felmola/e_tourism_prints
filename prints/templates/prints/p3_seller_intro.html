    Decision of the seller
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    <p>You were assigned to the role of seller. Remember that you will keep this role during the 5 trading rounds. You
        will be able to sell only one package per trading round. The computer will randomly assign you one of the 5
        available packages for you to sell in the market. Keep in mind that other sellers may sell the same package as
        you. Additionally, you will be given a "value" of that package. This value represents the cost you would incur
        if you were to close a transaction.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the costs are private, that is, only you know this number. Neither the other sellers nor the
        buyers know this information. In total there are 5 types of tourist packages whose only difference will be the
        destination: Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, Paris and Rome. You will only receive one of these and its respective
        cost.</p>

    <p>You will have to fix a price for the package that was assigned to you. This price must be higher than the cost
        of the package. Your earnings will be calculated as the difference between the price you set and the cost of the
        package. If you fail to complete a transaction, you will not incur any costs, but you will not make any profit
        either. Think of it this way, let's suppose you have a chance to get the package in question, and if you manage.
        to sell it, you'll earn the difference. The cost is what you would have to pay to get the package. If the cost
        is 5 ECU and you manage to sell the package for 7 ECU, then your profit would be 2 ECU. If you do not sell the
        package, your profit would be zero, i.e. you would not incur any costs and would not receive any income.</p>

    <p>Let's see another example:</p>

    <p>Suppose the cost of your package is 3 ECU and you manage to sell the package at a price of 5 ECU. You will then
        earn 5 ECU - 3 ECU = 2 ECU. If you fail to close a transaction, you will incur no cost or profit, i.e. your
        profit will be 0 ECU.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that two buyers can select the same offer, but only one of them will complete the
        transaction. The one who makes the decision to buy the package the fastest will be the one who completes the
        transaction with you.</p>

    <p>----> Conditional on the treatment, read the following statements <----</p>

    <p>----> Conditionally on: Commercial Practice Treatment <----</p>

    <p>Additionally, you can choose a commercial practice to help make your package more attractive in the market. There
        are three commercial practices and if you use them, they will be visible to the buyer at the time of completing
        the transaction. However, keep in mind that any of these commercial practices can be used truthfully or
        untruthfully.</p>

    <p>----> Conditionally on: Informal Sanction Treatment <----</p>

    <p>In the end, buyers will be able to report a seller if they think the seller used the practice untruthfully. If at
        least 3 buyers report that a seller used any business practice untruthfully, that seller will have to pay a
        fine. This fine will be 0.6 ECU plus 0.2 ECU for each additional buyer who reports it. The amount of the fine
        will be divided equally among the buyers who reported to the seller.</p>

    <p>----> Conditional Start: Formal Sanction Treatment <----</p>

    <p>In the end, we will audit two of the sellers randomly, i.e. the probability of being audited is 20%. If an
        audited seller is using some commercial practice untruthfully, the seller must pay 2 EMUs as a fine. These 2
        ECU will be distributed among the buyers.</p>

    <p>----> Conditional Start: Regret Treatment <----</p>

    <p>Please note that buyers will be given information about the price of the package they want to purchase before
        completing the transaction. If the price of the package is above the average, a message will appear with a sad
        emoticon indicating that. If, on the other hand, the price of the package is lower than or equal to the average,
        a happy emoticon will appear indicating that.</p>

    <p>----> End Conditional Text <----</p>

        be able to sell on the market.</p>
