    <p>There are three commercial practices available that buyers will be able to use to make their package more
        attractive to the market.</p>

                    destination, this one has the lowest price.</td>
                <td>Suppose you offer the package to Palau. There may be other sellers in the market selling the same
                    package to Palau, but if you opt for this commercial practice, you would be saying that, of all the
                    packages to Palau, yours is the cheapest.</td>

                <td>Suppose you offer a package to Palau. You can claim that you made a discount between the first price
                    you bid of 6 EMU and the final (the one you confirmed after deciding whether or not to observe the
                    competition)</td>

                    than the total price you are asking for it. The difference between the actual price and the price
                    you are displaying is equal to the cost for viewing the full list of packages (0.2 EMU), regardless
                    of whether you decided to pay this cost or not.</td>
                <td>Suppose you offer a package to Palau and the price you claim for this package is 8 UME. If you
                    decide to use this commercial practice, your offer will appear with a price of 7.8* UME, with a note
                    indicating the total price.</td>
