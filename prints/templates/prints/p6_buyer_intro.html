    Decision of the buyer
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    <p>You were assigned to the role of buyer. Remember that you will keep this role during the 5 trading rounds.
        You will be able to buy only one package per trading round. The computer will give you a "value" for each of the
        packages you will find for sale in the market. This value represents how much you value that package if you were
        to close a transaction. In total there are 5 types of tourist packages whose only difference will be the
        destination: Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, Paris and Rome. You will only receive five values, one for each package.</p>

    <p>Please note that the values are private, i.e. only you know this numbers. Neither the other buyers nor the
        sellers know this information.</p>

    <p>You will be shown a list of all package offers in the market and their respective prices. To close a transaction,
        you must select one and only one of the packages in the market. Your earnings will be calculated as the
        difference between your valuation and the price at which you purchased the package. If you fail to complete a
        transaction, you won’t make any profit. </p>

    <p>Think of it this way, suppose you have the ability to resell each of the five packages in question, and if you
        manage to get one, you will earn the difference. The value is what you would receive when you resell the
        package. If the value is 7 ECU and you manage to get the package at a price of 5 ECU, then your profit would be
        2 ECU. If you do not succeed in buying the package, your profit would be zero, i.e. you would not pay any price
        and would not receive any income.</p>

    <p>Let's see another example:</p>

    <p>Suppose that the value for the package you decide to buy is 5 ECU and you manage to buy the package at a price
        of 3 ECU. You will then earn 5 ECU - 3 ECU = 2 ECU. If you fail to close a transaction, you will incur no cost
        or profit, i.e. your profit will be 0 ECU.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that two buyers can select the same offer but only one of them will complete the
        transaction. The one who makes the decision to buy the package the fastest will be the one who completes the
        transaction.</p>

    <p>----> Conditional on the treatment, read the following statements <----</p>

    <p>----> Conditionally on: Commercial Practice Treatment <----</p>

    <p>Additionally, notice that the sellers can choose a commercial practice to help make their packages more
        attractive in the market. There are three commercial practices and if a seller uses them, they will be visible
        to the buyer at the time of completing the transaction. However, keep in mind that any of these commercial
        practices can be used truthfully or untruthfully.</p>

    <p>----> Conditionally on: Informal Sanction Treatment <----</p>

    <p>In the end, the buyers will be able to report a seller if they think he/she used the practice untruthfully. If at
        least 3 buyers report that a specific seller used any business practice untruthfully, that seller will have to
        pay a fine. This fine will be 0.6 ECU plus 0.2 ECU for each additional buyer who reports it. The amount of the
        fine will be divided equally among the buyers who reported the seller.</p>

    <p>----> Conditional Start: Formal Sanction Treatment <----</p>

    <p>In the end, we will audit two of the sellers randomly, i.e. the probability of being audited is 20%. If an
        audited seller is using some commercial practice untruthfully, the seller must pay 2 ECU as a fine. These 2 ECU
        will be distributed among the buyers.</p>

    <p>----> Conditional Start: Regret Treatment <----</p>

    <p>Please note that buyers will be given information about the price of the package they want to purchase before
        completing the transaction. If the price of the package is above the average, a message will appear with a sad
        emoticon indicating that. If, on the other hand, the price of the package is lower than or equal to the average,
        a happy emoticon will appear indicating that.</p>

    <p>----> End Conditional Text <----</p>

    <p>----> Conditional on the treatment, read the following statements <----</p>

    <p>----> Conditional Start: All treatment but control <----</p>

    <p>There are three commercial practices available that buyers will be able to use to make their package more
        attractive to the market.</p>

                    the seller is displaying is equal to the cost for viewing the full list of packages (0.2 ECU), regardless
                    of whether the seller decided to pay this cost or not.</td>
